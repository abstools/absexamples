This directory contains a simulation of the Monty Hall problem ([Monty
Hall problem -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)):

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three
> doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.  You pick
> a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors,
> opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.  He then says to
> you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?"  Is it to your advantage to
> switch your choice?
